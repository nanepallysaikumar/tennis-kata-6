# Tennis Game

This program stimulates a tennis game with below rules

* A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent.

* The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as “love”, “fifteen”, “thirty”, and “forty” respectively.

* If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is “deuce”.

* If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is “advantage” for the player in the lead.
